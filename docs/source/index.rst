Welcome to pyNS's documentation!
===================================

**pyNS** is the Python client library for accessing the `NeuroscoutAPI <https://neuroscout.org/api>`

**pyNS** enables advanced used cases not supported by the `neuroscout.org <https://neuroscout.org>`` 
web-based analysis builder, such as batch-creation of analyses, or meta-analytic applications.

See the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including :ref:`installation` of pyNS.

.. note::

   If you're just starting out with Neuroscout, take a look at the main website
   (https://neuroscout.org), and the accompanying `documentation <https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout/>`_.
