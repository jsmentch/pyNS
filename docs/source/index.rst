Welcome to pyNS's documentation!
===================================

**pyNS** is a Python client library for accessing the Neuroscout API.
In addition, **pyNS** enables advanced used cases not supported by the neuroscout.org 
web-based analysis builder, such as batch-creation of analyses, or meta-analytic applications.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including :ref:`installation` of pyNS.

.. note::

   If you're just starting out with Neuroscout, check out the main website
